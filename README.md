Training in Cityscapes dataset, implement semantic segmentation to detect objects like trees, buildings, roads, sky, cars, pedestrians, bicycles, stop signs, and traffic lights.

In semantic segmentation, each object is painted with tiny pixels that make up a computer image that belong to that classes of object. Each class of object has a unique color identification. For example, pedestrians are painted red, sky is painted light blue, cars are painted navy blue, sidewalk is painted pink, buildings are painted gray, roads are painted purple, and trees are painted green.

Here is the youtube link from my own camera with good augmented results:
